abstract = {In many applications of wireless sensor networks, a sensor node senses the environment to get data and delivers them to the sink via a single hop or multi-hop path. Many systems use a tree rooted at the sink as the underlying routing structure. Since the sensor node is energy constrained, how to construct a good tree to prolong the lifetime of the network is an important problem. We consider this problem under the scenario where nodes have different initial energy, and they can do in-network aggregation. In previous works, it has been proved that finding a maximum lifetime tree from all feasible spanning trees is NP-complete. Since delay is also an important element in time-critical applications, and shortest path trees intuitively have short delay, it is imperative to find a shortest path tree with long lifetime. This paper studies the problem of maximizing the lifetime of data aggregation trees, which are limited to shortest path trees. We find that when it is restricted to shortest path trees, the original problem is in P. We transform the problem into a general version of semi-matching problem, and show that the problem can be solved by min-cost max-flow approach in polynomial time. Also we design a distributed solution. Simulation results show that our approach greatly improves the lifetime of the network and is more competitive when it is applied in a dense network.},

This performance downgrade is usually hard to be offset by other methods, such as efficient rate adaptations. In this paper, we study this AP selection problem in a decentralized manner, with the objective of maximizing the minimum throughput among all clients. We reveal through theoretical analysis that the selfish strategy, which commonly applies in decentralized systems, cannot effectively achieve this objective. Accordingly, we propose an online AP association strategy that not only achieves a minimum throughput (among all clients) that is provably close to the optimum, but also works effectively in practice with reasonable computation and transmission overhead. The association protocol applying this strategy is implemented on the commercial hardware and compatible with legacy APs without any modification. We demonstrate its feasibility and performance through real experiments and intensive simulations.},

However, performing direct measurements on LBSNs is impractical, because of the security mechanisms of existing LBSNs, and high time and resource costs. The problem is exacerbated by the scarcity of available LBSN datasets, which is mainly due to the privacy concerns and the hardness of distributing large-volume data. As a result, only a very few number of LBSN datasets are publicly released.

abstract = {Broadcast scheduling for low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been extensively studied recently. However, existing solutions mainly focused on optimizing delay and (or) total energy consumption without considering load distribution among nodes. Due to limited energy supply for sensor nodes, heavily loaded sensors often run out of energy quickly, reducing the lifetime of the whole network. In this paper, we target at minimizing the maximum transmission load of a broadcast schedule for low-duty-cycle WSNs, subject to the constraint that each node should have the minimum end-to-end delay under the broadcast schedule. We prove that it is NP-hard to find the optimal schedule. Then, we devise a Load-Balanced Parents Assignment Algorithm (LBPA-A) that achieves $\lambda$-approximation ratio, where $\lambda$ denotes the maximum number of neighbors that are scheduled to wake up at the same time and is typically a small number in low-duty-cycle WSNs. Further, we introduce how to solve this problem in a distributed manner. Our simulation results reveal that compared with the traditional solutions, our proposed LBPA-A and distributed solution both exhibit much better average performance in terms of energy-fairness, total energy consumption and delivery ratio.},

abstract = {In a cognitive radio network (CRN), allocating spectrum resources to terminals is a fundamental problem due to dynamic characteristics of wireless spectrum. However, distributed spectrum allocation schemes are usually sub-optimal due to lack of global information, and existing centralized schemes merely assume the existence of global information collection method without implementing the protocol. In this paper, we propose to use SDN framework for bandwidth allocation and global information collection. Our system, called software defined multi-hop cognitive radio network (SDM-CRN), has a centralized controller executing high level strategies of resource allocation by communicating with the terminals via the OpenFlow protocol. In SDM-CRN, all routers have caching capabilities so that a user request may be satisfied by local routers. Consequently, the traffic in CRNs may be unicast, muticast, converge-cast or hybrid. To satisfy these traffic demands, SDM-CRN jointly optimizes the selection of radio interfaces, channels, and power levels. We conjecture that this problem is NP-hard, and propose a heuristic algorithm. This algorithm constructs a 4-dimensional conflict graph (4-DCG), generates a set of maximal independent sets, and allocates spectrum to terminals by linear programming. Extensive simulations show that SDM-CRN can efficiently utilize the bandwidth and improve the user experience in multi-hop CRNs. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio (CR) networks have an ample but dynamic amount of spectrum for communications. Communication rendezvous in CR networks is the process of establishing a control channel between radios before they can communicate. Designing a communication rendezvous protocol that can take advantage of all the available spectrum at the same time is of great importance, because it alleviates load on control channels, and thus further reduces probability of collisions. In this paper, we present ETCH, efficient channel-hopping-based MAC-layer protocols for communication rendezvous in CR networks. Compared to the existing solutions, ETCH fully exploits spectrum diversity in communication rendezvous by allowing all the rendezvous channels to be utilized at the same time. We propose two protocols, SYNC-ETCH, which is a synchronous protocol assuming CR nodes can synchronize their channel hopping processes, and ASYNC-ETCH, which is an asynchronous protocol not relying on global clock synchronization. Our theoretical analysis and ns-2-based evaluation show that ETCH achieves better performances of time-to-rendezvous and throughput than the existing work.},

On the other hand Sentinel completely avoids the bandwidth headroom required by existing proactive approaches like FFC, and improves efficiency of operating the expensive WAN. We make several technical contributions in designing Sentinel. We formulate traffic engineering with backup tunnels (TE-BT) as optimization programs. We propose an approximation algorithm to efficiently solve the problem. We further present a concrete design and implementation of the system based on Openflow group tables for backup tunnels. Extensive experiments on Mininet and numerical simulations show that similar to FFC, Sentinel reduces congestion by 45{\%} compared with rescaling, and its algorithm runs much faster than FFC. Sentinel only introduces a small number of additional forwarding rules and can be readily implemented on today's Openflow switches.},

Based on the new link coverage model, we investigate the target coverage problem with the minimum number of receivers, i.e., how to deploy least receivers to cover all targets when senders are pre-deployed. By transforming DOMINATING SET to LINK COVER, we prove that the minimum link cover problem (MLC) is NP-hard. Then we give two algorithms with guaranteed performance bounds. For density constrained MLC, we propose a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS). Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

abstract = {Sensors can be deployed along a road or a bridge to form a wireless sensor network with a linear topology where nodes have a spatial ordering. This spatial characteristic indicates relative locations for nodes and facilitates such functions as object tracking and monitoring in the network. We attempt to derive this ordering with RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) as the only input, which does not require attaching extra hardware to the sensor nodes. This requires a method for translating RSSI into spatial constraints. There are two candidate methods in the literature. The first method uses connectivity information among the nodes to calculate their relative locations. But analysis of real-world trace data indicates that it does not work well in reality. The second method assumes that closer nodes receive higher RSSI. However, we have proved that the relative localization problem is actually NP-hard under such an assumption. Fortunately, the problem turns out to be efficiently solvable if we adopt a new observation slightly different from the above-mentioned closer-higher RSSI assumption. This observation that the closest node always receives the highest RSSI is verified by the analytical results of the same real-world trace data. We then propose a spatial ordering method based on the observation, and evaluate it through various field experiments. Results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of over 99{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm using integer linear programming. The challenge is that some constraints are not linear in the optimization problem. To address this challenge, instead of the optimization problem, we formulate the decision problem, and solve each decision problem by integer linear programming. The optimal value is then found by binary search over all possible lifetimes. To reduce the running time, we preprocess the graph by decomposing it into bi- connected subnetworks, and propose various rules to reduce the number of candidate lifetimes.

Since the DFL system usually consists of battery-powered sensors, energy efficiency is a critical issue. However, existing works mainly focus on improving localization accuracy by designing various metrics to characterize wireless link attenuation, and none of them considers energy efficiency, specifically. We present EE-Loc, an energy efficient localization system, for locating and tracking people with higher energy efficiency and comparable localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art DFL systems. EE-Loc has two main energy efficient components. First, EE-Loc has a radio tomographic imaging (RTI) component that uses only one bit information to describe link attenuation. The one bit information is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) of Received Signal Strength (RSS), and we prove that RTI with this one bit information is sufficient for localization. Second, EE-Loc has a tracking component that deactivates many unnecessary links through predicting the person's location with Kalman filter to reduce energy consumption. We build a test-bed of EE-Loc using 16 sensors. The experimental results indicate that EE-Loc improves energy efficiency by 27.05{\%} compared to Spin∗{\textgreater} for locating a person, and reduces link measurements by 41.91{\%} for tracking a person, without compromising the localization accuracy.},
